# tinkering_graphics
> __main__.py contains the code for the "Higher/Lower" game.
> colours.py contains some pygame colour values.
> physics_engine.py was a massive waste of time, but proved to be very informative in my learning process dealing with forces and vectors.
> window_options.py allows fullscreen.
> tkinter test.py was some random project that I made making a triangle and such.
> reskin.py is the main project here, it's the tinkering graphics assignment 4.
